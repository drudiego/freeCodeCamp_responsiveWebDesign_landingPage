# Challenge #4 - Build a Landing Page

<p> This is Challenge #4 out of 5 from the Responsive Web Design course at freeCodeCamp.</p>

## Challenge instructions:

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks.

<p>- Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"</p>
<p>- You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)</p>
<p>- Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"</p>
<p>- You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link</p>
<p>- When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page</p>
<p>- You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"</p>
<p>- Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"</p>
<p>- Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address</p>
<p>- The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for</p>
<p>- The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address</p>
<p>- Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"</p>
<p>- When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)</p>
<p>- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport</p>
<p>- Your product landing page should have at least one media query</p>
<p>- Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once</p>
